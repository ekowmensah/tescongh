# Constituency Required Fix - member_add.php

## Issue
Previously, constituency was optional, but institutions would still load based on region alone. This could lead to incorrect institution selection.

## Solution
Made constituency **required** and institutions now only populate after BOTH region AND constituency are selected.

---

## Changes Implemented

### 1. ✅ Constituency Field Made Required

**Before:**
```html
<label>Current Constituency</label>
<select name="constituency" id="current_constituency">
    <option value="">Select Region First</option>
</select>
```

**After:**
```html
<label>Current Constituency <span class="text-danger">*</span></label>
<select name="constituency" id="current_constituency" required>
    <option value="">Select Region First</option>
</select>
<small class="text-muted">Required to load institutions</small>
```

---

### 2. ✅ Updated Helper Text

**Institution Field:**
```html
<small class="text-muted">
    <strong>Note:</strong> You must select both region and constituency to load institutions
</small>
```

---

### 3. ✅ Modified JavaScript Logic

#### **Region Change Handler**

**Before:**
```javascript
// Load institutions immediately when region selected
loadInstitutions(regionId, null);
```

**After:**
```javascript
// Clear institutions - wait for constituency selection
institutionSelect.innerHTML = '<option value="">Select Constituency to load institutions</option>';
```

#### **Constituency Change Handler**

**New Logic:**
```javascript
// Only load institutions if BOTH region and constituency are selected
if (regionId && constituencyName && constituencyId) {
    loadInstitutions(regionId, constituencyId);
} else {
    institutionSelect.innerHTML = '<option value="">Select Constituency to load institutions</option>';
}
```

---

## User Flow

### Before (Incorrect)
```
1. Select Region → Institutions load immediately ✗
2. Select Constituency → Institutions filter (optional)
```

### After (Correct)
```
1. Select Region → Constituencies load
2. Select Constituency → Institutions load ✓
```

---

## Visual Flow

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Current Location (School)                   │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Region: [Greater Accra ▼] *                │
│         ↓                                   │
│ Constituency: [Tema Central ▼] *           │
│               ↓                             │
│ Institution: [University of Ghana ▼] *     │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

## Validation

### Form Validation
- ✅ Region is required
- ✅ Constituency is required
- ✅ Institution is required
- ✅ Cannot submit without all three

### JavaScript Validation
```javascript
// Checks before loading institutions
if (regionId && constituencyName && constituencyId) {
    // Load institutions
}
```
