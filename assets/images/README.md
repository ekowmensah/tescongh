## How to Change the Logo

To change the TESCON Ghana logo on the login and registration pages:

1. **Prepare your logo image:**
   - Recommended format: PNG with transparent background
   - Recommended size: 200x200 pixels or larger (square)
   - File name: `logo.png`

2. **Upload the logo:**
   - Place your logo file in this directory: `assets/images/`
   - Name it exactly: `logo.png`

3. **The logo will automatically appear on:**
   - Login page
   - Registration page
   - Any other pages that use the brand logo

4. **If no logo is uploaded:**
   - The system will display "TG" text as a fallback
   - The text will be styled with the red gradient background

## Supported Formats
- PNG (recommended for transparency)
- JPG/JPEG
- SVG
- GIF

## Tips
- Use a square image for best results
- Transparent background works best
- High resolution images will scale down automatically
- The logo will be displayed in a circular container

## Current Status
- No logo uploaded yet (showing "TG" text)
- Upload `logo.png` to this folder to replace the text with your logo
